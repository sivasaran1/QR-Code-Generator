# QR-Code-Generator
This page generates the QR Code based on the given input data. The webpage was made using the Node js modules/Packages(Express, EJS, and qr-image). It has the EJS file that is rendered by the EJS backend. The main reason for using EJS here is to show the image if it exists and it makes the page dynamic.
